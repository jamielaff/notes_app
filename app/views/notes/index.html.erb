  <p>I am an ambitious, highly-skilled software development professional with more than 8 years experience in software design, development and integration. My roles have enabled me to expand my skills in web systems development, real-time application development and maintenance, integrating with high-profile payment systems, embedded software development, application programming and now Ruby on Rails.</p>
  <p>I have created this site in order to learn Ruby on Rails in my spare time, as this is something I have been extremely interested in learning.</p>
  <p>This project has full CI/CD using Heroku & Codeship.</p>
  <p>Below is a living TIL (Today I Learned) history of my journey into the world of Ruby.</p>
